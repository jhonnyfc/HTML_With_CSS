            The edges may be directed or undirected. For example, if the vertices represent <br>
            people at a party, and there is an edge between two people if they shake hands, <br>
            then this graph is undirected because any person A can shake hands with a person <br>
            B only if B also shakes hands with A. In contrast, if any edge from a person A to <br>
            a person B corresponds to A owes money to B, then this graph is directed, because <br>
            owing money is not necessarily reciprocated. The former type of graph is called an <br>
            undirected graph while the latter type of graph is called a directed graph. <br>
